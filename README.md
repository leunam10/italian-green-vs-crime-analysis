# italian-green-vs-crime-analysis
:boom: This is a data science project that investigates how green spaces influence local crime rates in Italian cities. By leveraging various datasets and statistical methods, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform urban planning and public safety strategies.

 ## Park Data 

:four_leaf_clover: The file *VERDE_URBANO_2011_2021_ISTAT.xlsx* contains the data from 2011 to 2021. The data for capital municipalities includes:

- planning tools (plan, regulation, census, ecological network)
- monitoring according to Law 10/2013 (planting of new trees, tree balance, national tree day, development of green spaces, risk of tree collapse)
- surfaces of publicly managed areas (by type of area with a revision of historical data series for the years 2011 to 2020)
- Natura 2000 network
- protected natural areas
- agricultural parks.

## Crime Data

:hocho: The file *individuals_reported_and_arrested_or_detained_by_police_forces.csv* contains data from 2004 and 2022:

Crimes reported to the judicial authority by the State Police, the Carabinieri, and the Guardia di Finanza: The data relating to the crimes and the individuals reported by the police forces to the judicial authority are processed.
The data comes from the operational activities of the police forces and does not follow the subsequent judicial process of the reported incidents.
It should be noted that the number of reports referring to individuals reported does not exactly match the actual number of individuals reported. The same alleged perpetrator of a crime is counted each time they are reported in the considered year, for each crime committed.
The sum of crimes distinguished by province may not match the total for the region, and the sum of the regions may not match the total for Italy, due to the lack of specification, for some crimes, of the place where they were committed (or the indication of the region where the crime was committed but not the province).
