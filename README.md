# italian-green-vs-crime-analysis
This is a data science project that investigates how green spaces influence local crime rates in Italian cities. By leveraging various datasets and statistical methods, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform urban planning and public safety strategies.

the survey with data extracted from the computer archives of the Public Prosecutor's Offices for adults aims to produce statistics on criminal proceedings in which the Prosecutor's Offices either close the case or initiate prosecution. Information is collected on the individuals under investigation (age, gender, place of birth) and the crimes attributed to them (felonies or misdemeanors and the place where the crime was committed) according to either an analytical or a synthetic classification of the crimes.
